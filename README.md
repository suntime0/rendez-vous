Rendez-Vous
===========

A BuddyPress plugin to let your community members schedule appointments. Rendez-Vous is a french word.. But i think it has an approaching meaning in english ;)
It's a "doodle" like feature plugin where the organizer defines some dates and hours to meet and the potential attendees will select the ones that match their agenda.
The organizer can then define the definitive date and once this date is past, he will also be able to add some notes or a report to inform about what happened during this meeting.

Available in french and english.
